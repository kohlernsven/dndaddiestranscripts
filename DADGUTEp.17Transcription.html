I play Darryl Wilson, a stay-at-home coach dad who&#39;s now a barbarian in the Forgotten Realms. Since we&#39;re in the world of Fortnite, I figured we should explain Darryl&rsquo;s relationship to it. So, my dad fact is, obviously Darryl just wants to kind of, you know, engage in whatever sort of sport or activity Grant&rsquo;s in. That&#39;s why he</span><span class="c0 c18">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Freddie:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;He&rsquo;s a good dad.</span></p><p class="c7 c15"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s why he met up with the Chelsea Boys, et cetera. So of course, when he heard about this FortNite, he had to go figure out what it was. Grant plays it on his computer so one day when he was at school, Darryl went onto his computer to figure out how to play FortNite and he went to the FortNite Reddit and put a post on there as Grant, and this is what he wrote-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Oh my God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Oh my God.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">He said, &quot;Trying-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">As Grant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t know.

So I did some homework and this is what he wrote. He went on to the FortNite Reddit and said, the topic was how to play FortNite: just want to play and he wrote, &quot;Hello everyone. My name is Darryl Wilson. Really nice to meet you or should I said, e-meet you all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Fuck yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">&quot;I am a 42 year old man with a son named Grant. Like most of you kiddos, he loves the FortNite and while I know a thing or two about sports, this bad boy is new to me. If any of you experts could give me some tips or ideas for a first timer, that would be great. First and foremost, if someone could just explain how to start the game, that would be great too. Talk soon.&quot; And then he signed off with his email address.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Oh my gosh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">So since then, he&#39;s never figured out how to play FortNite. That&#39;s all he pretty much knows, he never figured out Grant found out that he posted this, got really upset and he continuously gets emails from 12 year olds calling him horrible, like what 12 year olds would say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c6 c16">Has </span><span class="c6 c16">Darryl</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ever been on /r/relationships because I feel like he might have posted there too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Not yet, probably soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Carol has definitely been there on our throwaway account.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Hey, who is thi - Oh this lady sounds just like my wife, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">No, she can&#39;t be, she&#39;s too upset. Now I&#39;m picturing a shop around the corner situation where you&#39;re giving Carol advice on her relationship with you. What&#39;s up everyone? I&#39;m Will Campos.

What&#39;s people&rsquo;s pet situation like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">I figure Glenn&#39;s got a big iguana or snake of some kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, I could see that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Do you remember that first episode?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">Oh I don&#39;t remember that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t pay attention to the podcast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t listen to this podcast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">So, Henry&#39;s family, the Oaks, have three pets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Oh boy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">They have a goat named Earth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I&#39;m leaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">They have a bird named Cloud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Fuck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">And they have a dog named, Laser Wolf Fart Blaster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Henry named that one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, no it tells a story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">So Henry named the goat and then Mercedes named the bird, and then Lark and Sparrow got to name the dog and Lark wanted to name him Laser Wolf and Sparrow wanted to name him Fart Blaster. You know, Henry was really proud of his boys, they came to a compromise and then the dog&#39;s name is Laser Wolf Fart Blaster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">They call him, Laser Wolf Fart for short.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s a goldendoodle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yes, oh my gosh. I want the goat and the golden doodle. I was just so obsessed with the golden doodle, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Beth May and I play Ron Stampler, emotionally detached step father and rogue. This we&#39;re doing this in the FortNite universe, I should clarify that I know absolutely nothing about FortNite. I don&#39;t even know what it looks like when it&#39;s being played. I have no idea any of the characters or whatever or if there even are characters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s adorable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s like I&#39;m a millennial, be like, &quot;What is Facebook?&quot; I don&#39;t know but the dad fact that I have this week is that Ron has never had a cavity. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Does he brush his teeth?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yeah. No, no he brushes his teeth. Maybe he has had a cavity but he probably thinks that a cavity is an extra butt hole or something. He thinks it&#39;s like a cavity, he doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a tooth thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Fucking wild card.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Does he go to the dentist?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">I&#39;m not entirely-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah how do you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">So he doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s had a cavity?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">I mean, I think he&#39;s pretty sure, like he knows but he objectively-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">He&#39;s like, &quot;If I had another cavity, I&#39;d know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yeah. Yeah, he knows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">But has he gone to the dentist?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">He hears other people talking about how many cavities they have and he&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, whoa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I just want to understand him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">I feel like he goes to the dentist and he&#39;s like, &quot;Can I get a cavity search?&quot; and then it&#39;s just not-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">I see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">And they&#39;re like sir you need to leave. Sir this is a Whole Foods.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yes, because he has an extra butthole.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">He goes to the dentist and asks for a cavity search and they poke around his mouth and say, &quot;You have no cavities.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">He said, &quot;You do have a cavity.&quot; and he goes, &quot;Oh I guess that means I have an extra butt hole.&quot; and then he leaves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Well, he doesn&#39;t have one so obviously, yeah. He doesn&#39;t-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Good point, good point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">I do have an extra butt hole, and this is Beth May.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know why that broke me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s like maybe not-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Everything you&#39;ve said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">Not the weirdest thing Ron has come up with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, I think that is. All right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">I&#39;m Anthony Burch. I&#39;m your Daddy Master. I am at a loss after the cavity thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">How many butt holes do you have?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Counting you guys?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c13 c22">[episode start]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">You all were basically going to get ready for the big competition FOR Nights and you went and talked to Geralt of Trivia and you got some cool items and then you checked out the library and found out after Darrel got his hand licked off and then reattached-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, that was weird.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Erin O&#39;Neil sort of disappeared, you were going to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Yeah, so I want to point out really quick, there must be something about the Bully Wogs restroom situation, the way it&#39;s laid out because we&#39;ve now abandoned both MPAA at the previous Bully Wogs, and now Erin O&#39;Neil at this one. Is there like a-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">You know, but Erin O&#39;Neil came with us to hide the Honda Odyssey because remember we parked the Honda Odyssey and then her magic trees covered the Odyssey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">So I guess she was just hanging back then. Is that the-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">With the Odyssey?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah. She didn&#39;t join us on the-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Or did she like the Bully Wogs so much that she went back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Look, Anthony doesn&#39;t forget things. He&#39;s like JJ Abrams, everything that&#39;s happened is setting up... There&#39;s going to be an explanation as to why they disappeared. Is that right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">I will say it did not occur to me and I think all the dads just straight up forgot that Erin O&#39;Neil was part of the adventure. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m very glad she didn&#39;t go with you because she knows stuff. She&#39;s an intelligent character, understands the world and the fewer of those that are around you guys, the better things tend to go as a podcast. Both she and MPAA are like, &quot;Oh, you guys are dicks.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the more pressing and immediate issue is that you got into the carriage that led up into the sky and when you woke up, Grant was there, so that means that you now have 24 hours to strip him of his flesh and eat it or else all of you die, but you also, remember having talked to Erin O&#39;Neil about it and done some research that if you can change his inherent nature, like if he turns from a boy into a man or a man into a werewolf or whatever the fuck, you get out if it. If he&#39;s undead or whatever, there&#39;s some ways that you&#39;ve researched to maybe get around this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Either way, the clock is now ticking and as you are sailing through the sky, Grant&#39;s like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant:</span><span class="c0 c8">&nbsp;So yeah, do you have any questions about this because this is my second one of these and I am pretty good at it so far?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I hug him again. I quickly, I pull out. I take a coin out of my pocket and I scratch on my watch exactly the time that it is in that moment and I look around and say </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl:</span><span class="c0 c11">&nbsp;We have 24 hours guys. Do you understand? 24 hours. Grant, hey everything&#39;s fine buddy, how&#39;s it going?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I&#39;m fine. What happened to your watch?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I try not to cry and I hug him. </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl:</span><span class="c0 c11">&nbsp;Oh nothing man just really happy to see you buddy.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Are you actually crying?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">No, no, no man. What are we doing here? Where are we doing?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Darryl, it&#39;s okay to cry, I mean, it&#39;s a pretty intense situation.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">We got 24 hours. We can cry after and believe, there&#39;ll be a lot of that if something happens.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I feel like the questions are wasting time when you have to kill him in like 24 hours anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Whoa, whoa, wait what? Sorry what?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Okay, so I&#39;m not sure if I have this straight because actually okay, you don&#39;t look anything-</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Ron, Ron, Ron dad huddle, dad huddle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I put my hand on Ron&#39;s mouth-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">No, I like stop him from talking and he&#39;s like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl:</span><span class="c0 c11">&nbsp;No, we just came from a really crazy place we got to go, we got to be back in 24 hours-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Roll deception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s an 11.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay.

We&#39;re a little short on it, this new world and everything so-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Well, hopefully before the 24 hours, we are also going to figure out how not to-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Dad huddle, dad huddle.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Dad huddle, Ron.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Dad huddle real quick, dad huddle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;By the way, I love how we&#39;re inadvertently stumbling into one of the legitimate FortNite strategies which is wait until the end when the thing boots you out automatically.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Okay, dads-</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Ron, can we not stress out Grant right now?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">He will... Look he acts tough, he is a tough kid but can we not tell him what&#39;s going to happen?

I don&#39;t want to say it right now either because it&#39;s tough for me to say.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Okay. I completely understand.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Ron, you often have said that you&#39;re going to do one thing and I&#39;m not calling you a liar. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing it on purpose, but sometimes immediately afterwards you do the other thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I&#39;m not going to do the other, whatever the other, other thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Gentlemen, I need to remember something. I associate it with a name or word, so maybe when you see Grant you&#39;ll think Grant and then you&#39;ll say, &quot;G&quot; because Grant&#39;s name starts with a G and then you&#39;ll think to yourself, &quot;Gee, I better not tell him about the blood pact where we have to eat his face.&quot; Then, you don&#39;t eat his face. Do you think you can follow that?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I think I could, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Okay. So, let&#39;s say I&#39;m Grant and then you look at me and what do you think?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Grant, starts with the G.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Good.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Good... is what your skin would taste like.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">We&#39;ll work on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">Grant?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, yo.

Nights-</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">FortNite, yeah the video game you like?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah! It&#39;s a really neat coincidence. It was super, super cool because I got bought as a slave. I was like &quot;Oh, no that&#39;s not good.&quot; but then they brought me here and apparently they used to have some other sort of ways of entertaining people, but then they adopted this whole FortNite kind of thing and they threw me in here and I don&#39;t even have to kill people.

It is a Nintendo. Imagine it is the biggest Nintendo that there is.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">I remember there was this YouTube channel that my beautiful boys, Lark and Sparrow, were into where they would do these silly videos where people would be in a video game, but it was in real life and so you&#39;re saying this is kind of like one of those YouTube channels that were really successful about four or five years ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Maybe even a little longer further back.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I would say, this is exactly that. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening right now. So let me, as quickly as I can, explain the way that FortNite works to you because I feel like everybody except for-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Wait can you use the rosebud cheat code?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">The what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Rosebud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s like if you&#39;re playing a video game, but you&#39;re in real life, it&#39;s like the SIMS. There&#39;s a video game called the SIMS and then if you want more, if you want to win you just type in rosebud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Anthony is really getting broken by that right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s just a good, deep cut for SIMS fans. SIMS fans are fucking loving that shit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">This one goes out to all my SIMS fans out there. I see you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">So Grant has never played the SIMS.

Okay so the way that this game works, is there&#39;s 20 teams and if we can make it to the top five, we survive.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">So the first time, you got in the top five?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, first time I got in the top five. I just sort of hid a lot, it was great.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Well, what place did you get?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Then, there was this other team that helped me that was really... As he mentions the other team he just like kind of gets flustered. He&#39;s like, they were great too, they were really cool.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">My boy. Top five everybody.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c20">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c20">Yeah, so-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Pretty good, yeah good job Grant.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I was number five.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Well that&#39;s not-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">We&#39;ll try to do better this time. That&#39;s still good.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I mean that&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Yeah. It&#39;s better than the other 15.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, I mean they&#39;re dead now so, yeah that makes-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Wait, what?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">So if you&#39;re in the bottom 15 you die, and you&#39;re allowed to kill each other and stuff to make sure that you&#39;re in the top five and all that kind of stuff. So basically the way it works is, there are 10 zones that we&#39;ve already coasted passed about five of them while we&#39;ve been talking. A through J. Any time you want to, we started at A, we are now around like F. We can jump out of the carriage and land and every zone has a main building or a location that has a lot of stuff in it and we can search for stuff in that location and the items we find might be really, really useful or really, really rare and any of that kind of stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Then, every 15 minutes of like real us talking in podcast time, two of the zones will get targeted as, hey in 15 minutes from that point they will get filled with poison gas and anybody inside of it will start taking damage over time. It&#39;s either a poison or it&#39;s like a weird neon thing, I really can&#39;t tell because I haven&#39;t never been stuck in it because I&#39;m good at moving every time that one of those turns on. As it goes on, eventually it will get down to either when only five teams are left, all of those people get to live and then they get to go on to the next game of For Knights, tomorrow essentially.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">How do we get out of here? If we win, can we leave?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, yeah if we get in the top five, we can leave no problem.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Why do people keep playing?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">What are you doing? Why are you here?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Because it&#39;s fun as heck.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">You said that people died though?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">That is so dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I mean, not if you play the way I play.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Oh jeepers creepers.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I&#39;ve played a lot of FortNite. You&#39;ve seen the John Wick skin that I have. I have the John Wick skin.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Son, but you&#39;ve seen people die.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">No. I mean, you hear about it when somebody dies. The announcers in the hot air balloon announce it, but I haven&#39;t seen it happen. That would be a bummer.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">They go, &ldquo;m-m-m-m-monster kill!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, pretty much.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">And if we do this then we can get the thing we need to do the thing we need to do, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c6 c11 c16">Yeah I mean,</span><span class="c3 c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c11">How long does this game take?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">This game takes one day. Every game is 24 hours.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Wait, 24 hours?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Oh, go cool. We got plenty of time.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Why don&#39;t they call it FOR Day?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Because it was originally it was a tournament for knights, but then they eventually ran out of knights because the knights started dying and then they extended it to FOR Nights and people that we capture and slaves and they got kind of dark but they kept the name FOR Nights because it just rang off the tongue so well.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s one of those names that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with what it ended up being because originally-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">All right, all right, we should drop. We need to drop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay, okay. Do you want me to tell you what the remaining places we could drop in are and you can decide?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">So what is this drop? What are we dropping?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Oh, you&#39;ll see, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;ll be a neat surprise. So the zones are A for Armory, B: bomb maker, C: cafeteria, D: deli/slaughterhouse, E as in egg farm, F is fucking shit ass toilet building, G has a tavern, H has a haberdashery, I has an ice cream shop, and J has a jewel cutters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">So, we go to one of these places. The locations are slowly going to fill up with gas and we&#39;re trying to survive and not get killed until we&#39;re one of the top five teams that are left-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Grant, buddy, you&#39;re the coach on this one. We&#39;re your team, you&#39;ve done this before. I think you tell us where we should drop-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">Does ice cream have actual ice cream?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">It does, but you got to get to it quick or it just kind of melts and everybody gets... Ice cream can get kind of rowdy because they sometimes take kids from the unfortunate foster children and then those kids go straight for the ice cream and it&#39;s a real, I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a real bloodbath if we go in there.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Wait so a bunch of foster children die in this game?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, this one time.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Oh my gosh.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">It&#39;s not great, I mean I don&#39;t approve of their business practices, but like- </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">You&#39;re still playing. Okay, we&#39;re going to deal with that once we&#39;re done with this because I&#39;m-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Just so you know, you&#39;ve seen on Grant&#39;s face, you see a very particular kind of joy and excitement that is a little bit alien to you. This isn&#39;t like, &lsquo;hey I&#39;m having fun playing soccer&rsquo; joy. There&#39;s like something else here that you haven&#39;t seen before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Like the thrill of battle?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know, maybe you&#39;ll find out. But he goes like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I feel like we could drop at the tavern in G, the pub G.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Oh, God almighty.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Because sometimes there&#39;s a rifle there.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">And you know your old man likes his brewskies, so-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">And the brewskies, yes, so maybe we could do that-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay so let&#39;s drop tavern.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Okay. I have more questions, but I&#39;ll figure them out after we drop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">I have more to explain anyway, but I will break it up with some action.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">So drop is when the beat hits finally, right?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">He goes, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">No, it&#39;s like this. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">And he jumps out of the carriage with his arms like in a Christ Air pose.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Grant!</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I leap instantly after him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay go ahead and roll acrobatics.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">That my friends is a natural 20.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Oh, perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Sail, sail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">So you dive out and you immediately put him in a bear hug and the two of you are just plummeting down together. Roll a perception with disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s a natural 1.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Everything&#39;s fine. So as you two are plummeting down, he goes, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Dad, you have to let go. It&#39;s going to be really bad if you don&#39;t let go.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">What do you mean? What are we doing, we&#39;re falling?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">No, we&#39;re going to get, it&#39;ll be fine but you have to let go. You have to give me some space.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay, do we have parachutes?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay, you let go first.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I can&#39;t not let go. You grabbed me in a bear hug.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay, okay. I&#39;m not letting go but I say I&#39;m letting go.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Okay anytime. We literally have three sec-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Okay I let go, I let go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">So you let go and as you both let go it all, I assume you guys are still in the carriage or did you guys jump out after them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">I&#39;m waiting to see whether these guys are going to turn into friggin&#39; street pizza when they hit the ground before I&#39;m going to jump out of this thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay well the longer you wait, you will drop into a different zone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">I jump out feet first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay, so anybody else-</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">Henry, we got to stick together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">I&#39;m going to grab Henry and jump out with him.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">I&#39;m afraid of heights!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">So you guys who just jumped out, see beneath you. You see the Wilson boys simultaneously like massive translucent jellyfish, just sprout out from their clothing basically and like inflate and their descent slows precipitously. Grant goes like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, when we fall asleep these things just attach to our bodies and then they&#39;ll leave when we land, but it&#39;s cool right? This is cool.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">It&#39;s pretty weird. This is scary. Your dad doesn&#39;t like heights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">He&#39;s like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Oh no, this is going to be great, this is going to be great. As long as we&#39;re-</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Get over here son. Get a little closer.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">No because then they might tangle up and then it would be bad.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">So then, the rest of you, your jellyfish also expand and you all slowly start dropping down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Are they like little sentient jellyfish?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Mm-hmm (affirmative)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">I want to talk to mine. I&#39;m going to be like hey, what&#39;s up little dudes? Yeah, dig it.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Grant are people dropping with us, should we be looking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yeah so as you look around you can see there&#39;re a lot of people dropping at the armory. You can already hear a lot of swords clashing and a lot of people punching each other and shit like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">The clear sounds on this winter morning of people punching each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">People punching, fucking Shaw brothers like sound effects. At the deli/slaughter house you can already see people beginning to build structures out of wood. Some of these buildings how are straight up and Grant points and goes, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I&#39;ll explain who that works when we land, but we can do that too. We can build stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Hell, yeah. You didn&#39;t tell me there&#39;s carpentry up in here.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Yeah, no I thought you might like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Beth: </span><span class="c0">I think Ron doesn&#39;t think that he has a jellyfish and he&#39;s like, all these other people need jellyfish to float down, but I can do it naturally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">But seemingly nobody is going to the pub G, so it seems like you&#39;re fine there. When you land, the pub G, it looks like a very functional pub. Visually there is very little that inspires you. It&#39;s kind of bland, it&#39;s kind of boring looking, but you can tell the purpose of the place which is just a place to get drinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">From far away, its textures seem a little blurry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">It&#39;s a little blurry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">And as we get closer, they seem to slide into resolution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">But it&#39;s still kind of brown and green, it&#39;s not really exciting all that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">Are there a bunch of knock-off pubs all around it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yeah. There&#39;s the detritus of failed knock-off pubs all around. There&#39;s an H1Z1 zone. That one&#39;s not funny, delete that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">Nope, it&#39;s staying in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Oh, gross. But yeah, it&#39;s a rundown pub that you can tell has a lot of alcohol behind the bar, it might have some other stuff in the area behind the bar. There might be an office back there, you don&#39;t know, but you&#39;d have to search. Grant goes like, </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">Okay, do you want me to explain everything else? The way this works?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c4">Glenn: </span><span class="c0 c4">Yes, please.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Okay. So mechanically here&#39;s what we can do. When you are at a spot, you can roll to either look for items or you can roll to forage for crafting materials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Can we split up and do that or is it as a group?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Each of you can individually do that. So if you&#39;re searching for stuff, you basically just roll and if you get a good D20 roll then you get an item that is appropriate to that location, depending on how good the roll is. If you rolled a forage for wood, then you roll the D20 and you get that much wood or you can halve that roll and we can say that&#39;s how much stone you got.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Clever, clever girl.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">And when you build stuff out of wood, it&#39;s easier to destroy than stuff you build out of stone or whatever. Basically the stuff that you can build, it will be variable depending on how clever you want to get, but the basic things I wrote down here was, it costs five wood to build a wall or five stone to build a wall. 10 to build a house and then 30 to build like a tower that will allow you to look out and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Hell, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">You can either collect the shit and then try to build it later or build here so you can get better vantage points and shit like that, but you have, I&#39;m now going to start a timer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Oh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">We have 15 minutes of real life podcast time before I-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Until we find out which areas are getting closed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yes.

You&#39;ve done 2 damage to him, you kind of open up a little wound over his eye and he starts bleeding a little bit and he&#39;s staring at you with even more fucking hatred in his eyes. Since he&#39;s paralyzed we don&#39;t have to do initiative or proper combat or anything like that because combat in D&amp;D is like every round is six seconds, you basically have 10 free rounds of doing whatever you want to this guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Will: </span><span class="c0">I turn around and I just say, </span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c2">Henry: </span><span class="c0 c10">Make it quick whatever you do.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Ron, you want me to do this?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">I can shoot him again.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">That wasn&#39;t shooting him.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">What?</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">That wasn&#39;t shooting him.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">Okay, well I have to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">So I have to concentrate, so I can&#39;t do anything right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">You&#39;re holding him the entire time.</span></p><p class="c1 c12"><span class="c3 c5">Ron: </span><span class="c0 c5">All right, you go ahead and you shoot Deuce Bigalow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Matt: </span><span class="c0">I grab the shotgun, I point it at his head. </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c11">Darryl: </span><span class="c0 c11">Grant there is no way you got, people die, you got to kill people in this?</span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I mean, some people have to die, we don&#39;t have to be the ones to kill him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anthony:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And he&#39;s looking at you holding a shotgun to this guy&#39;s head and he&#39;s like, </span></p><p class="c1 c9"><span class="c3 c8">Grant: </span><span class="c0 c8">I mean this guy, he&#39;s a bad guy but I don&#39;t, this feels weird man.
