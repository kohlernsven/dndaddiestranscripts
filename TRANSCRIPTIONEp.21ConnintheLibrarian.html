Basically, short rest is really good for healing your health, it&#39;s not as good for getting your spell slots back. That&#39;s the main difference between that and long resting.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">[</span><span class="c2">group comprehension</span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Will: </span><span class="c0">Oh I see.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt: </span><span class="c0">That&#39;s also the thing. Your short rest, you don&#39;t recover your hit die until you do a long rest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Right.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Little quick retcon there because we&rsquo;re about to get into&mdash; </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Little quadruple dad-nap.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">Yeah. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Will: </span><span class="c0">So I roll 6d8?

Special thanks this week to all of our Patreon supporters for helping make this show possible but especially thanks to Kelsey Day, Dylan Codil, Aaliyah Shuford, Rabble, and Jonathon Stevens. Those folks definitely listened to the Witch is Dead before this episode came on, and I hope you did, too, if you&#39;re not a Patreon supporter.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">We have all kinds of cool one shots and have all kinds of good clean fun on our Patreon. For example, this Thursday part two of, &quot;At the Mountains of Dadness&quot;&mdash;the prequel mini series, &quot;Call of Cuthulu&rdquo; campaign&mdash;is releasing, which features some of the tensest game play we&#39;ve engaged in thus far!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c4">That&#39;s available to Patreon supporters at all levels and if you like the creepy body horror of the Library, I&#39;ll think you&#39;ll really like this mini series. Also, we are moments away from getting a merch store finally up and running and, just like Disneyland, we&#39;re opening up access to the merch store early to our Patreon supporters.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">That analogy doesn&#39;t work. Disneyland doesn&#39;t have a Patreon. So, if you want the first crack at the first run of dad merch, please consider supporting us at patreon.com/dungeonsanddads and stay tuned very soon on our social media and right here for where that merch store is going to be.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Oh yeah, social media. Everyone&#39;s got those. Dungeons and Dads on Twitter. Bit.ly/dungeondads for a private Facebook group. r/dunegonsanddaddies for that sub-reddit and bit.ly/DADGUT, all caps, for the group transcription project.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">Thanks so much for listening. Next episode coming at you November 26th, T=that&#39;s just before American Thanksgiving. And before I go, F.A.S.T. is an acronym to help detect and enhance responsiveness for the needs of a person having a stroke which stands for Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, and Time to call emergency services.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">[</span><span class="c2">outtro finishes</span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt: </span><span class="c4">[</span><span class="c2">almost imperceptivly off-mic</span><span class="c4">] </span><span class="c0">I want clarification on my Spirit Shield.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Freddie: </span><span class="c0">How about you get clarification on sitting in front of your fucking mic?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Okay.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Oh, my god!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;[</span><span class="c2">laughs</span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Beth: </span><span class="c0">Do you remember when we were a family?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">[</span><span class="c2">laughter</span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Anthony: </span><span class="c0">You have to keep that in now.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Matt: </span><span class="c0">Yep.
